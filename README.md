# BumperCall
**I made this project in my second semester of engineering as a final project to a subject 'Computer Networks'. I discovered the technology of WebRTC from a YouTube tutorial by the Traversy Media channel, where Dennis Ivy taught it with passion and clarity.**

A point to point video call web app is a web application that allows users to make video calls directly with each other, without relying on a central server or intermediary. It uses WebRTC, a technology that enables real-time communication of audio, video, and data in web browsers and mobile applications. WebRTC provides APIs for capturing media devices, establishing peer connections, and exchanging media streams. A peer to peer video call web app typically requires a signaling server to exchange information between peers, such as their network addresses, media capabilities, and session descriptions. Once the peers agree on the connection parameters, they can communicate directly using the best available route. Peer to peer video call web apps have many advantages, such as lower latency, higher quality, better privacy, and lower costs. 'Lobby.html' is main gate to enter the room of video call. I use agora for signaling and screensharing between peers and it uses mesh topology for multi-connection
